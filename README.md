uKOM Extractor is the extraction code part of the uKOM Archiver (Private) software.
I provided this code public FOR SCIENCE!

uKOM Extractor is under GPLv3 License, so you can do whatever you want with this project but you must keep it Open Source.

# Have fun and please, if you want to improve/extend this archiver you're free to push new commits.
If it reaches a good visibility then i may do the entire uKOM Archiver Open Source.
